# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Mod 1 Excel kickstarter
* I have two major recommendations. 
1)First, reduce your goal amount. Statistically, successful US plays with a goal of roughly 5k had fully funded pledge amounts. The average goal of a failed US play was roughly 10k and pledges rarely met their goals. 
2) Second, release you play in May or June. Globally, these two months had a significantly higher success rate.
