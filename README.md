Mod 1 Excel kickstarter
* Two major recommendations for a successful play
* First, reduce your goal amount. Statistically, successful US plays with a goal of roughly 5k had fully funded pledge amounts. The average goal of a failed US play was roughly 10k and pledges rarely met their goals. 
* Second, release you play in May or June. Globally, these two months had a significantly higher success rate.
